## Algorithmic Comparison & Prediction of Real Estate Pricing

# Proposed Model

We used a dataset called "Bengaluru House Price Data" for this project. The steps involved include:

1. Data Cleaning: Perform extensive data cleaning to ensure accurate results during prediction.
2. Machine Learning: Use K-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV to find the optimal procedure and parameters for the model.
3. Server: Write a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests using the saved model.
4. Frontend: Build a straightforward HTML frontend where users can input details (square feet, BHK, bathrooms, location) and click 'ESTIMATE PRICE' to receive an estimated price. JavaScript will handle backend communication and UI updates.
5. Comparison: Add and compare an additional algorithm to determine the better one.

# Technologies Used

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building and machine learning algorithms
5. Colab notebook, Visual Studio Code
6. Python Flask for the HTTP server
7. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the UI
